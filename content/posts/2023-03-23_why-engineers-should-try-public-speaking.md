Back in 2021, I was a marketing manager for an IT company and let's just say, my technical skills were a little shaky. So, I did what any sane person would do - I went to a coding bootcamp, got my first coding job, and boy was I hooked! It's true what they say, "you never stop learning in tech" - or at least until the robots take over.

But being a marketing pro, I couldn't resist the siren song of content creation. I created a Twitter profile and started a YouTube channel and found that the more I taught, the more I learned. And let's be real, if you can't explain coding to a five-year-old, do you even know what you're talking about?

Now, let's talk about the speaking side of content creation. Because nothing makes you feel alive quite like presenting to a room full of people who have no idea what you're saying.

### The different types of speaking engagements
There are many different types of speaking engagements:

- Conference talk
- Meetup talk
- Twitch/YouTube stream
- Podcast
- Twitter Spaces

There are other ways to create content that doesn’t require “taking a stage”, whether it’s a virtual or real-life stage. We’ll talk about those in a bit.

Depending on how far along you are in your coding journey or how comfortable you feel teaching others about what you'll be speaking on, these all require preparation. And that work upfront helps us grow as engineers.

### But seriously, is public speaking really useful for engineers?

I know what you're thinking:

. . . "I'm not interested in speaking to big groups"

. . . "I'd rather stick to my code and avoid all that public speaking nonsense"

. . . "I'm not looking to be the next Steve Jobs, so why bother?"

But here's the thing, when most people think of public speaking, they picture a motivational speaker riling up a stadium or a stand-up comedian making a room full of people belly laugh.

That's a very limited view of public speaking. To me, any time you're talking and others are listening without any give-and-take, you're in public speaking territory.

Pitching your company to other engineers? That's public speaking.

Explaining your firm's vision to potential hires at a job fair? Yup, still public speaking.

Presenting your latest project to your team or voicing your opinion on where to take a project? You guessed it, still public speaking.

Even if you never have to give a keynote to a crowd of thousands, this skill is still worth developing. At some point in your career, you'll have to present your ideas, your work, and yourself to your colleagues or clients. If you can't articulate your thoughts and persuade others to see your point of view, you'll always be a step behind.

Being able to speak up and persuade others is one of the most powerful ways to make an impact in your career. So, get out there and start practicing those public speaking skills!

## 5 benefits from speaking in public

### 1. Speaking can help clarify your own thoughts

Speaking can be scary. Believe me, I get it. But with practice, you can at least become a little more confident. When creating content without a "stage," you have more room for error, but when you have to perform in front of others, that fear of messing up kicks in. It forces you to work a little harder and focus more before presenting to the world.

My tactic is to choose a topic I want to master and speak on it. Try it! 

You'll be amazed at how much your knowledge on the subject will grow because of the added pressure of performing live. It's a daunting task, but the payoff will be worth it.

> Don't wait for a conference to present live. Get on platforms like Twitch or YouTube and stream the thing that's been holding you back. Ask for help and feedback from your viewers. We're all there to learn together, and no one is hoping for you to fail. I promise.

### 2. Learn as you teach

When you teach others about a topic, you end up learning more than you expected. You start anticipating the questions that might come up, preparing for potential problems, and trying to simplify the information for your audience. Suddenly, you're a teacher!

You'll need a thorough understanding of the topic to explain it in a simple and relatable way. You may even end up spending two hours on preparation for every hour of content. And if it's a new concept for you, the preparation time could be three or more hours.

> Don't procrastinate, start learning today! Choose a topic you've always been interested in but haven't had the chance to explore. Create a blog post or a YouTube video about it, and hold yourself accountable by tweeting about it. Your newfound knowledge and skills will be worth it!

### 3. Build your resume

Every time you create new content, you're essentially adding another badge to your online tech resume. This is particularly useful if you're just starting out in the tech industry, with only a handful of projects or freelance gigs to your name, or if you're still considered a "junior" (which is a bit of a subjective term, but let's roll with it for now).

Let's imagine that your tech resume is at a "one job" level. But you've recently presented at three different meetups, been a featured guest on two tech podcasts or live streams, and published an article in a well-regarded tech publication. Suddenly, your resume showcases a wide range of tech topics that you're knowledgeable about and capable of explaining. Plus, you can easily provide links to your content, giving potential employers a chance to see your confidence, energy, and expertise when it comes to all things tech!

> Go and revamp your resume today by including any and all tech content that you have created or contributed to. Have you participated in a panel discussion? Did you make an appearance on a tech stream? Have you answered several questions on Stack Overflow? Ensure that you organize the information in a clear and concise manner to avoid overcrowding, but it's essential to highlight your contributions. Make sure your resume reflects all the tech-related skills you have gained.

### 4. Nail your interviews

It can be nerve-wracking to be in the spotlight during a job interview, where your future with the company is at stake. All attention is on you, both literally and figuratively.

This is your chance to make a lasting impression and either succeed in landing the job or fail to convince the interviewer. Public speaking skills, such as presenting information in a clear and engaging manner, are crucial during interviews. Mastering this skill can make all the difference in whether you receive an offer or a rejection.

Keep in mind that securing the interview is only the first step in the job search process. You must now demonstrate to the interviewer why you are the best fit for the job. Simply having a strong resume is not enough if you struggle to answer questions or can't articulate your thoughts clearly.

### 5. Join a community and make friends

Building relationships with others in the tech industry can be invaluable for personal growth and career opportunities. Whether you attend or speak at events, you have the chance to connect with peers and receive feedback that can help you improve. Networking can happen both in-person and online, such as through virtual conferences or social media platforms like Twitter. Even attending events as an audience member can be a great way to make connections.

> Attend a tech conference or meetup and reach out to speakers whose talks resonated with you. Thank them for their presentation, mention specific points that you found helpful, and ask for their advice on getting started with public speaking or their expertise in the technology they discussed. Starting a conversation can help you build relationships and may even lead to speaking opportunities in the future.

### Where to find these opportunities
