So, you‚Äôre on the hunt for a remote job? You should already have an updated resume, professional LinkedIn profile and polished portfolio (should I make a post/video about these 3?). If you don‚Äôt have these, stop reading this post RIGHT NOW and go work on them. Otherwise, keep reading to find your next dream company.

### Before you start¬†applying

Before you start clicking apply left and right, remember what I always say ‚ÄúNetwork your way in‚Äù. Clicking on the apply button won‚Äôt even reach the HR‚Äôs computer. You‚Äôre competing against thousands of candidates, so if you get referred by someone that already works at that company, your chances will improve by 80%!

You may ask me, ‚ÄúBut I can‚Äôt ask a stranger to refer me to their company; they don‚Äôt even know me!‚Äù. Yes, I know. That‚Äôs why you should be networking way before you start applying for jobs. But in any case, if you haven‚Äôt and you‚Äôre looking for jobs now, this is what I would do.

1. Check out the list of companies below, their website, product, and culture.
2. If you like any of them, see if they are hiring for any type of dev job (you can also look them up on LinkedIn).
3. Found a job where you have around 60% of the skills listed? Look up the employees that work at that company.
4. Do you know any of them? Do you have friends in common or something in common with any of them (from the same city/country, went to the same school, have same hobby etc)?
5. Message them.

WAIT, STOP. Don‚Äôt just say ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm looking for a job. Can you refer me to your company?‚Äù

NO

NO

That‚Äôs not how you do it. First, you have to build a relationship with the person, so they feel comfortable in referring you. The best way to do it is to ask for a [coffee chat](/the-complete-guide-to-ace-your-next-networking-coffee-chat-cf5b4ba79ec). When I first started learning to code, I did over 100 coffee chats, probably 2 or 3 a week. I met so many people online from several different areas/industries. I have a log of all my coffee chats on a Notion page so I can remember who is who and what we talked about.

You can message them on Twitter, LinkedIn or by email (I personally prefer Twitter) and say:

![](/img/2022-12-22_6-steps-to-land-a-remote-job-list-of-remotefirst-companies_1.png#layoutTextWidth)

OR

![](/img/2022-12-22_6-steps-to-land-a-remote-job-list-of-remotefirst-companies_2.png#layoutTextWidth)

From there, we would schedule the chat, and after it, I would follow up or keep in touch with the person.

Now going back to the job application.

6. Supposedly you know a few people in the industry by now, so now you could reach out again and ask for another chat, or ask for a referral right away. It depends on how bold you are but know that maybe people will say no, and it‚Äôs ok! Don‚Äôt feel bad about the NO‚Äôs you get in life. They will only help you grow and become stronger.

7. Keep doing that until you start getting interviews and land that sweet dream job!

### Remote-First Companies

This is by no means an exhaustive list of **remote companies** out there, but I picked a few companies that I personally like‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeither because I use their tools or because I really enjoy their vision! The list is ordered alphabetically (thanks adhdüòÖ).
